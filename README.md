# Crypto Portfolio Tracker

A minimalistic way to track your crypto portfolio.

Provides an easy way to keep track of all crypto transactions, providing a history of buys/sells, and visualised gains/losses. 

## Motivation

This was something I wanted to create for my personal use as I wasn't entirely happy using other alternatives. I wanted to see my portfolio in a very specific way and this was a good opportunity to build the product myself.

## Tech

Built with React, Redux, and Firebase.

Using the [Coingecko API](https://www.coingecko.com/api/documentations/v3#/) for price data.

See package.json for full list of libraries.
